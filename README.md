## About the project
This is a React movie search app; my first project in React.js to learn about useState and useEffect to fetch data from an external API.

## Technologies
This projects uses:
* `npm` as package manager
* `react` as component library
* `css` as component stylizer
* `webpack` as module bundler
* `babel` as JavaScript transpiler
* `OMDb` as The Open Movie Database

## Setup

Clone this repository or download the source code. You will need `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.

Generate an API key from http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx, by selecting Free!(1,000 daily limit button), then edit this line http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey], in the App.js file, with your API key.

Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies. 

After that, run `npm start`, to run the application locally in local server host.

## Status

This project's version is completed. In the future, I intend to implement more features like Movie Reviews and a direct link to watch a selected movie.
